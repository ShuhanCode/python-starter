#  22. Lists - FAQ

**Lists FAQ**

**1. How do I index a nested list? For example if I want to grab 2 from [1,1,[1,2]]?**

You would just add another set of brackets for indexing the nested list, for example: my_list[2][1] . We'll discover later on more nested objects and you will be quizzed on them later!
